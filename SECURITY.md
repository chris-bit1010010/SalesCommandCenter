# Security Considerations

## Known Vulnerabilities

### xlsx (v0.18.5)

The `xlsx` library has known vulnerabilities:
- **Prototype Pollution** (affects versions < 0.19.3)
- **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)** (affects versions < 0.20.2)

**Status**: No patched version available as of the latest release.

**Risk Assessment**: 
- **LOW RISK** for this application because:
  - We only use xlsx to **create/export** files, not to parse untrusted input
  - The vulnerabilities primarily affect parsing operations
  - This is a presentation/dashboard tool, not a file processing service

**Mitigation**:
- Do not use this application to parse Excel files from untrusted sources
- If parsing user-uploaded Excel files is needed in the future, consider:
  - Using a different library (e.g., `exceljs`)
  - Implementing additional validation and sanitization
  - Running parsing operations in a sandboxed environment

### jsPDF (v3.0.3)

The application uses jsPDF v3.0.3, which includes patches for:
- ✅ DoS vulnerability (patched in 3.0.2)
- ✅ ReDoS bypass (patched in 3.0.1)

**Status**: No known vulnerabilities in the current version.

## Recommendations

For production deployment:

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Run `npm audit` and `npm update` regularly
2. **Monitor security advisories**: Subscribe to security notifications for key dependencies
3. **Consider alternatives**: If Excel export from untrusted data is required, evaluate:
   - `exceljs` - More actively maintained, better security track record
   - CSV export as a simpler alternative
4. **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input before processing
5. **Implement CSP**: Configure Content Security Policy headers in production
6. **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all communications are encrypted in production

## Development vs. Production

This implementation is designed as a **presentation and dashboard tool** with mock data. For production use with real user data:

- Replace mock data generation with proper API calls
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Add rate limiting for export operations
- Consider server-side export generation for better security
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Add input validation and sanitization at all entry points
